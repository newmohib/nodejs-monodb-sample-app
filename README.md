### Mongoose
    1: ODM: Object Data Modeling for Node.js
    2: in mongoose have store with BSON (Binry Object Notation)
    3: Abstraction from row low level MongoDB
    4: Relationship between NoSQL Data
    5: Provides Schema Validation
    6: Object - Data Mapping- translation of data into object that our code undestands and vice versa
    7: 40 -60% less code compared to row mongoDB package
    8: 

### Details
    1: Table/Collections

### What is No-SQL 
    NoSQL is a non-relational database that uses key-value pairs to store and retrieve data. Unlike a relational database, which stores data in rows columns.
### Non Relational Database
     NON Relational database is a collection of Unstructured and Selmi Structured Items Which Do Not Store Data in Tabular Form
### NoSQL Type:
    1: Key Value: Redis, Riak: 
        Usage: Briskly changing data and high availablility
    2: Column Based: HBase, Cassandra
        Usage: Read/Write Extensions 
    3: Document Database: MongoDB, Couchbase
        Usage: Working with occasionally changing Consistent data
    4: Graph Database: Neo4J, Big Data
        Usage: Spatial Data Storage

### What is MangoDB?
    MongoDB is a NoSWL (Not only SQL) database that stores large vlumes of data in the form of documents. MongoDB removes the concept of "rows" of conventional and relational data models by introducing "documents". This offers the developers the flexibility to work with evolving data models.

    DocumetnBased: Represents Hierarchical relationship in a sing record insted of multiple tables.
    RelationalDataModel: Highly structured table organization with rigdly-defined data formates and record structure.
    DocumetnDataModel: Collection of complex documents with arbitary, nested data formats and varying rocord format.

### What is SQL
    Structured query language is used to communate with dtabase. allows the user to access and manipulate data stored in the database.
    Relational database is the used to organize structure data into tables in the form of rows and coumns.


### Why we Use NoSQL:
    1: Hierarchical storage structure insted of a table like structure.
    2: Constand addition of new feature and functions.
    3: Relationship Between Stored Data is not importent

### Types of NoSQL Database
    1: DOcument Oriented
    2: key value Pair
    3: Column Based
    4: Graph Oriented
